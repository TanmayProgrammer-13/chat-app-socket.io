# Realtime Chat App (Socket.io)

In This Post We Will Be Creating a Realtime Chat App Using Socket.io And JavaScript Framework Express.js 

Prerequisites For Development:

- express.js (npm install express)
- Socket.io (npm install socket)

## What Is Socket.io?

Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.

## Why Socket.io?

Socket.IO allows bi-directional communication between client and server. Bi-directional communications are enabled when a client has Socket.IO in the browser, and a server has also integrated the Socket.IO package. While data can be sent in a number of forms, JSON is the simplest.
## Installation
Install Express.js

```bash
   npm install express
```
Install Socket.io
```bash
  npm install socket
```
